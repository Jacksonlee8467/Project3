# Project3
CS-210 SNHU Project 3

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Project 3 was assigned in order to showcase the skills required to connect the C++ and Python programming languages. THe program itself read a file of inventory in which the program would provide valuable insights into. The three functions were as follows:
1. Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
2. Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
3. Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.

## What did you do particularly well?
Over this course, I feel like I have vastly improved on commenting throughout my code. I struggled throughout the course to be able to connect files of different programming languages together for one functioning program. I am proud that I was able to understand and comprehend how the two languages can be put together to make this happen. Most importantly I am proud that I am making the conscious effort to write out comments throughout my code to provide direction and explanation for others reading through my program.

## Where could you enhance you code? How would these improvements make you code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Practice practice practice. I still feel very apprehensive starting to code on a project. A blank screen with no code on it still intimidates me a little. To combat this, I use a flow chart and pseudo code, but I always wonder if I am make ing the best decisions to write the best program. As I continue to write cod and grow my experience, I should be able to draw from my experience to write code that is more efficient and more secure.

## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of this project for me was navigating all of the folders for my project. I specifically struggled to find the appropriate location to save my input file. A resource that I plan to take more advantage of moving forward is GitHub and it's community. 

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Being able to connect two separate programming languages into one program will be beneficial in many different areas. Being able to code in multiple languages is an asset employers look for. Presenting a program written in multiple languages will showcase my skills and expertise. Coding in multiple languages will also help decide whiere to begin. SOmetimes deciding which language is best for a particular program can be a challenge due to their individual limitations. Being able to write different parts of a program in different languages will help make that decision easier.

## How did you maike this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by apply industry best practices. Specifically, I tried my best to make the main function of the program as clean as possible and clearly defined each function used. Anyone that would need to make adjustments to the program should be able to easily identify which function does what and how they connect.
